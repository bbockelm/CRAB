TestSuite need a config file containing a row for each test one 
wants to run. Each row is in the form of:
nicename, cfg, timeout, timeout2
where nicename is a free name you give to a test in order to recognize it
lately, cfg is a string containing the name of a crab.cfg like file to
open and timeout/timeout2 is the number of second after which the
linear/wow test respectively is interrupted.
TestSuite -h gives a brief help about its options.
