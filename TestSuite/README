This is a request for comment release of the TestSuite-1.0.
TestSuite need a config file containing a row for each test one 
wants to run. Each row is in the form of:
cfg, nC, nS
where cfg is a string containing the name of a crab.cfg like file to
open, nC is the number of job we expect to create and nS is the number
of job to submit
TestSuite -h gives a brief help about its options.
